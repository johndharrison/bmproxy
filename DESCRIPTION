Description: Wrapper around the 'BrowserMob Proxy' REST API for R.
    'BrowserMob Proxy' is a utility to help web developers watch and 
    manipulate network traffic from their AJAX applications. It captures 
    performance data in the HAR format. In addition it can actually 
    control HTTP traffic, such as: blacklisting and whitelisting certain 
    URL patterns, simulating various bandwidth and latency, remapping DNS 
    lookups, flushing DNS caching, controlling DNS and request timeouts
    and automatic BASIC authorization
