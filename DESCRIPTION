Description: 'BrowserMob Proxy' is a utility to help web developers watch 
    and manipulate network traffic from their AJAX applications. It 
    captures performance data in the HAR format. In addition it can 
    actually control HTTP traffic, such as: blacklisting and whitelisting 
    certain URL patterns, simulating various bandwidth and latency, 
    remapping DNS lookups, flushing DNS caching, controlling DNS and 
    request timeouts and automatic BASIC authorization. This package
    provides an R client for the 'BrowserMob Proxy' REST API.
