\usage{
reqInterceptor(proxy, jsFilter, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{proxy}{An object of class "proxy". A proxy object see
\code{\link{proxy}}.}

\item{jsFilter}{Javascript request filters have access to the variables 
request (type io.netty.handler.codec.http.HttpRequest), contents 
(type net.lightbody.bmp.util.HttpMessageContents), and messageInfo 
(type net.lightbody.bmp.util.HttpMessageInfo). messageInfo contains 
additional information about the message, including whether the 
message is sent over HTTP or HTTPS, as well as the original request 
received from the client before any changes made by previous 
filters. If the javascript returns an object of type 
io.netty.handler.codec.http.HttpResponse, the HTTP request will 
"short-circuit" and return the response immediately}

\item{...}{Additonal function arguments}
}
\value{
invisible(proxy): An object of class "proxy" is invisibly
   returned. A proxy object see \code{\link{proxy}}. This
   allows for chaining from this function to other functions that take
   such an object as an argument. See examples for further details.
